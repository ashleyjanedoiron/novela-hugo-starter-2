## This is my first blog post

Hello World

Easy migration

Not much to say here. You literally just have to copy your art-boards — or as they call it, frames — then paste them into Figma. Simple as that. The platform is very forgiving and prepared for transitions.

## Zero file management

What does that mean? Sketch, Framer, Adobe XD or even Photoshop are native apps where you inherently need to save your work. Some tools have auto-save, of course, but you still end up with hundreds of megabytes and even gigabytes on your drive. And yes, if you lose your disk, break your computer somehow, or have your dog eat your SSD, you will lose your files completely.

Not with Figma. Not having to command+s is a big deal. Figma is a web-based software, meaning you never need to upload, download, or worry about versions again. Imagine a Google Docs for design, keeping all my projects organized in one app, in the cloud. One single source of truth for design files.

I probably saved more than 30GB of disk space by migrating my projects to Figma, and now I can access them from anywhere.

## Figma is platform-agnostic

One of the best features of a web-based software is the fact you’re no longer stuck with an operating system. You can run it right from the browser or from their native app, that’s essentially a wrapper. I’m able to seamlessly start a project on my iMac Pro at my home office, and continue on my Surface Book 2 on the go. That’s huge.

Additionally, you’ll always have the latest version, with no need to download painful software updates. The “cloud” is finally making sense in 2018.
